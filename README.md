# PantryNET
Chico State, like many other universities, has a food pantry for students who do not have access to enough to eat.The pantry provides food for students for free by storing donated and wholesale purchased bulk foods.
We want to create a system to manage the inventory of a food pantry, as well as generate reports about the pantry's activities. We need to design a website that manages the information.
